# outset

Minimal, unassuming, front-end foundation. Configured for HTML5 and Sass, built with Gulp.
*Outset-stylus* is a fork of *[outset](https://github.com/callmecavs/outset)*, made by
[Michael Cavalea](https://github.com/callmecavs), where *stylus* is used in place of *sass*.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install outset-stylus -g
```

## Use

In your terminal:

```bash
$ outset-stylus [path]
$ npm i
$ gulp
```

In your browser:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

Get building! Work in the `src` folder, deploy from the `dist` folder. The `index.html` file comes wired up.
